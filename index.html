                        <h3>What is Learning Disability?</h3>
        
                        <p>
                            A learning disability ( LD) is a neurological condition which affects the brain's ability to send, 
                            receive and process information. A child with a LD may have difficulties in reading, writing, speaking, listening, 
                            nderstanding mathematical concepts and with general comprehension. LD's include a group of disorders such as dyslexia, 
                            dyspraxia, dyscalculia and dysgraphia. Each type of disorder may coexist with another.

                        <p>
                            Some children though, are slow learners but they eventually learnabd cope with their studies and other activities. 
                            Some may not be interested in specific type of learning e.g new language, specific activity or skill, academic subject 
                            e.t.c. some others may not be interested in sports or any other outdoor activities. Theae attributes indicate the child's 
                            interests and are not indicative of a learning disability.
                        </p> <br>

                        <p>
                            In general, 5% of school age children are affected by learning disabilities. Children with a learning disability may also have ADHD.
                            It's advised to seek help from a mental health expert or other trained specialists for the required intervention program or therapy. 
                            You could go for an extra help, individualized education program, therapy and complimentary/alternative therapy.
                        </p> <br>

                        <p>
                            Parents, teachers and/or experts should set goals and assess if the child is improving with the selected mode of intervention and support.
                            Some children however might have a multiple learning disability and such case should be treated carefully, closely and patiently.
